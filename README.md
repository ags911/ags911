More people are considering joining Airbnb to profit by investing in new properties to transform into Airbnbs. But how will they know what to consider to make their property an attractive proposition for customers? And how will they increase profit? |

| <img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dsnd/blob/main/project-2/images/aid.jpg" width="250" height="150"> | In this project, we used data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight. This data was used to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. A machine learning pipeline was created to categorize these events so that the messages could be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project also includes an interactive web app. |

**[Project 4: The Truth About Airline Statistics](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%204%20-%20Communicate%20Data%20Findings/communicate_data_findings.ipynb)**

This dataset reports flights in the United States from 1987 to 2008 including arrival and departure delays, carriers, and other data. For our analysis, we are sampling the three year period between 89' to 91' as our sample dataset as the whole dataset is too large to practically observe with Jupyter. Findings will be visualised in univariate, bivariate and, multivariate plots.
