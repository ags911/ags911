## Data Scientist Projects

<!-- Project 1 -->

Airbnb is a popular way for home owners to make money by renting out their properties or even spare rooms in their own home. 
More people are considering joining Airbnb to profit by investing in new properties to transform into Airbnbs. 
But how will they know what to consider to make their property an attractive proposition for customers? And how will they increase profit?

**[Project 2:  Disaster Response Pipeline Project](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dsnd/tree/main/project-2)**

In this project, we used data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight. This data was used to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. A machine learning pipeline was created to categorize these events so that the messages could be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project also includes an interactive web app.

<!-- Project 4 -->

**[Project 4:  Starbucks Capstone Project](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dsnd/tree/main/project-4)**

This project uses simulated data to provide insight to how people make purchasing decisions, and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. The data contains various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases. Our task is to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer by finding traits and purchasing patterns.

## Data Analyst Projects

<!-- Project 0 -->
<a href="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/tree/main/project-0"><img align="left" width="250" height="150" img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/images/output_2_0.png"><a/>
**[Intro Project: Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%200%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends/Project%200%20-%20Exploring%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb)**

The Exploring Weather Trends project will demonstrate using SQL and downloading data from a database. We will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends.
<br></br>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<a href="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/tree/main/project-1"><img align="left" width="250" height="150" img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/images/output_4_0.png"><a/>
**[Project 1: Investigating TMDB Movies Dataset](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset/Project%201%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset.ipynb)**

In this project, we will choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. We will complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
<br></br>

<!-- Project 2 -->
<a href="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/tree/main/project-2"><img align="left" width="250" height="150" img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/images/output_6_0.png"><a/>
**[Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20Analyse%20AB%20Test%20Results/Project%202%20-%20Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results.ipynb)**

In this project, we will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an landing page experiment. We’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report our conclusions and recommendations in a report. We will also use machine learning and logistic regression to predict how various factors might affect conversions depending on the landing page.
<br></br>

<!-- Project 3 -->

<a href="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/tree/main/project-3"><img align="left" width="250" height="150" img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/images/output_8_0.png"><a/>
**[Project 3: We Rate Dogs Twitter Analysis](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyse%20Data/ipynb_files/act_report.ipynb)**

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, we’ll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. We will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

<a href="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/tree/main/project-4"><img align="left" width="250" height="150" img src="https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/images/output_10_0.png"><a/>
**[Project 4: The Truth About Airline Statistics](https://github.com/ags911/udacity-dand/blob/main/Project%204%20-%20Communicate%20Data%20Findings/communicate_data_findings.ipynb)**

This dataset reports flights in the United States from 1987 to 2008 including arrival and departure delays, carriers, and other data. For our analysis, we are sampling the three year period between 89' to 91' as our sample dataset as the whole dataset is too large to practically observe with Jupyter. Findings will be visualised in univariate, bivariate and, multivariate plots.
